Def:
	Command - Object that represents an instruction to perform some action. It contains all in info required for the action to be taken.
		- Object represents an operattion such as:
			- X should change field Y to value Z
			- X should do action W

Why?:
	- Allow undor / redo of commands
		- C++ statements perish after they are executed
		- Can't directly serialize a sequence of actions to keep a history
	- Allows recording of macros


How?
	- Create a command class that encapsulates all the details of the operation required (arguments, reference to object etc)
	- The command class will invoke the operations through itself.
	- Can also add undo functionality or serialization functionality for the commands by
		- Calling opposite methods than the orignal once -> Undo
		- Write commands to file and allow auditing

Composite Command:
	- Using the composite design pattern 
	- Store commands as a vector or data structure of commands to process
	- Can go though each one and call the command itself
	- Allows for creating macros etc.
