Def: Mediator:
	- A component that allows communciation between other components, without them having direct references or contact with each other.

Why?:
	- Components can come into the system and also leave the system at any time
		- Players in a MMORPG
		- Users in a chat room
	- These components should not be able to reference each other directly,
		- Would lead to dangling pointers when one left and be very complex to keep adding new ones when they joined

IDEA:
	Mediator is a Central Component (Like a bus) where each component can communicate to others.

Implementation:
	- Createa a central component bus/broker (i.e. a chat room)
	- Each object then has a reference to that broker mediator
	- The mediator has functions that the individual clients of it can call to communicate with others
	- The clients in turn have functions the mediator calls to realise that communication to other clients


Boost Signal and RxCpp libraries implement these patterns very well.
